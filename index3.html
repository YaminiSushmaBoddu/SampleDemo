        Maldives
    </h1>
    <p>
        The Maldives is a nation of islands in the Indian Ocean, that spans across the equator. Far stretched white sandy beaches flanking the turquoise blue Indian Ocean, stilted waterside villas, a romantic candlelit dinner with a glass of champagne at the gazebo on water â€“ Maldives is all about luxury and tryst with nature. Often called as the Manhattan of the Indian Ocean, the metropolis charm of the Hulhule Island is blended perfectly with the tropical charm and that is one of the prevalent reasons to visit Maldives.
